# # Assignment 3: Monte Carlo Simulation for Inventory Management
import random
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ## Scenario
# In this assignment, you will use Monte Carlo simulation to help a retail company manage its inventory. 
# The company sells a single product, and the daily demand for this product is uncertain. 
# You will simulate the daily demand over a month (30 days) to help the company determine optimal inventory levels.

# ## Tasks

# ### 1. Simulate Daily Demand and Analyze Results
# Write a function that simulates the daily demand for the product over the next n days using a Poisson distribution.

# **Steps:**
# - Assume the average daily demand (`Î»`) is 20 units.
# - Use `numpy` to generate Poisson-distributed daily demand for n days.

# **Analyze the Results:**
# - Plot a histogram of the simulated daily demand values.
# - Calculate and print the following statistics from the simulation results:
#   - Mean (average) daily demand
#   - Standard deviation
#   - 5th percentile (to understand the lower bound in a worst-case scenario)
#   - 95th percentile (to understand the upper bound in a best-case scenario)
# - Interpret the results in the context of inventory management.
